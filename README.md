# COPS Algorithm Contribution Challenge

This repository includes your second challenge of this week. To accomplish this
challenge successfully you had to get a PR(pull request) merged into this
repository which includes an algorithm from the following given [list](https://github.com/COPS-IITBHU/cops_algorithms/blob/master/List_Of_Algorithms.md). Your PR
is required to have proper title and description and make sure the algorithm you
will be adding must go in the proper folder.

## Guidelines

- Only one algorithm should be included in your PR from the given list.
- Your algorithm should goes in the proper language folder in the repository.
- You can make new folder for new language if it not exists currently.
- Scores of different algorithms are also listed in the algorithms list.
- Try to write code on your own rather than coying it from other sources.
